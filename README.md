# Example-Code
Demonstrative Programs and Sample Code for PND Tech Club Reference, Distributed in Various Languages.


Primarily, this repository is intended as a consolidated reference of code that a person in Tech Club new to programming would be able to utilize and learn from. At minimum, this repository should act as a place for PND Tech Club to share basic programming examples in various languages and store them for later reference.


Using `git` for the complete beginner:

`git clone https://github.com/pnd-tech-club/example-code.git` <- creates a new folder with the repository inside it, `cd` into the directory.

`git add path/to/files` <- adds files to the queue to upload to the repository (the `*` wildcard works. Ex: `git add C/*.c` would add all `.c` files in the `C/` folder.

`git commit` <- creates a commit to upload to the repository

`git push` <- pushes your commits

`git pull` <- updates the repository folders
